# age-in-minutes-app
My "Age In Minutes" app from Udemy course "The Complete Android 12 &amp; Kotlin Development Masterclass".

I've coded the app herein in Kotlin. It receives the user's birth date as an input and outputs his age in minutes. 

This exercise approaches mainly the following concepts:

- [X] Resources (colors and strings);
- [X] Linear layouts;
- [X] Basic views (`TextView` and `Button`);
- [X] `DatePickerDialog`; and 
- [X] Basic date manipulation.
